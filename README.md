Title: Package Routing System (Google Maps / FedEx Routing Application)

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to develop an application for routing the package system similar to FedEx routing mechanism.

Technologies: Java 8 SE, JSwing, JUnit.

Tools & Platform: Netbeans IDE, Git (Version Control), JDBC, Apache Tomcat, JUnit (Unit Testing Framework).

Functionality : The application has been implemented with client side system using design patterns such as Factory, Strategy that uses Dijkstra's algorithm over Floyd warshall and Bellman Ford algorithms for package routing because Dijkstra's works on the concept of BFS that finds the shortest path between a node and every other node in the graph. 

The following goals have been achieved by the above application:

● This application uses java programming language for implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm where user only needs to enter the destinations of packets along with source.
● The application calculates the best possible shortest route with maximum delivery of packets.
● This application can be applied anywhere as the business logic that runs on best time complexity and increases the impact time by 50%.

Achievements: 
-- Achieving the best case time complexity for any input of destinations given to the application.
